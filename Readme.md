These are are the [Adventure Kid single-cycle waveforms](https://www.adventurekid.se/akrt/waveforms/adventure-kid-waveforms/) from Kristoffer Ekstrand, translated into SuperCollider wavetables using a variation of a method Alik Rustamoff [explained on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9fmNHgUKzc&list=PLXCUkMwOEWQtB-leHHSexTizzcACdozp9&index=5). 

A [visual reference to the wave shapes and spectra](https://www.adventurekid.se/AKRTfiles/AKWF/view/waveforms_index.html) is on Kristoffer's blog. This is helpful for picking candidate wavetables.
